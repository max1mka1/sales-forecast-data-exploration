# sales-forecast-data-exploration
Data preparation for forecasting task. Project for Jovian cource "Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas". Course Project Final Submission.
This dataset was a test task for building a sales forecast for the month (March 2020). 
We have historical data for 2 full years, as well as 1 quarter of 2020. 
The dataset was provided by "Zolotoe Yabloko" store and shows sales for two brands across three stores.

Context

In this test task, you need to build a sales forecast for the month (March 2020).
You have historical data for 2 full years, as well as 1 quarter of 2020.
The dataset shows sales for two brands across three stores.
Content

There are 4 files in a dataset:

    sales_train - sales for the period from 2018.01.01 to 2019.03.31
    Items - this table contains common information on brands
    stock - this file contains count of days with zero balance for items
    test_submission - a sample of what the final file should look like.

Inspiration

This task is a forecasting task. The expected content item:
• Carry out preprocessing of data (search for anomalies, removal / cut of outliers, etc.). Conduct time series analysis (graphical presentation, descriptive statistics).
• Summarize the results of the cleaning, data preprocessing. Draw conclusions based on your analysis.
• Feature engineering
• Which of the algorithms is better suited. What data do you think you need to enrich the current dataset for more accurate, effective sales forecasting.
• Construction of a forecast and its assessment. Please comment on your chosen metric to evaluate the forecast. MAE, RMSE, etc? and why. Is it necessary to use CV in this example? Will it give the best result.
